This is a .NET Core web application for searching Flickr for camera and lens data, as those functions aren't offered by the official Flickr site (at the time of writing this).

Documentation is incomplete here as I'm only writing this as I archive the repository. Sad, I know. Oh well—here for your perusal anyways! Have a swell day ⭐️
